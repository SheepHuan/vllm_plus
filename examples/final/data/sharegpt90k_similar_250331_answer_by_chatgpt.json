            "chatgpt_output": "De reden dat je ondanks het kiezen voor een `passwordless` client alsnog wordt gevraagd om een wachtwoord in te voeren, is dat dit wachtwoord niet voor de client zelf is, maar eerder voor de **private key van de Certificate Authority (CA)**. Dit is een cruciaal beveiligingsmechanisme dat wordt gebruikt tijdens het genereren van certificaten. \n\nLaten we dit in detail bekijken:\n\n### 1. **Wat is een \"Passwordless Client\"?**\nAls je kiest voor een \"passwordless client,\" betekent dit dat de private key van de **clientcertificaat** niet versleuteld wordt met een wachtwoord. Wanneer een gebruiker dit clientcertificaat later gebruikt om verbinding te maken met de OpenVPN-server, is er geen prompt voor een wachtwoord—de verbinding werkt direct op basis van de certificaten. Dit kan handig zijn in scenario's zoals geautomatiseerde scripts, IoT-apparaten, of andere toepassingen waarbij het niet praktisch is om telkens een wachtwoord in te voeren.\n\n**Belangrijk:** Dit staat dus los van de CA-configuratie.\n\n### 2. **Waarom vraagt het systeem dan toch om een wachtwoord?**\nHet wachtwoord dat hier wordt gevraagd, is specifiek bedoeld om toegang te krijgen tot de private key van de **Certificate Authority (CA)**. De CA is verantwoordelijk voor het ondertekenen van alle aanvragen voor nieuwe certificaten, inclusief die van je passwordless client.\n\nDe CA-sleutel is een uiterst gevoelige sleutel die beveiligd wordt met een versleuteld wachtwoord. Zonder dit wachtwoord kan de Easy-RSA toolkit (of welk systeem dan ook dat je gebruikt) de private CA-sleutel niet ontgrendelen om nieuwe certificaten te ondertekenen.\n\nSamengevat:\n- Het **CA-wachtwoord** beveiligt de infrastructuur van certificaatbeheer.\n- Het **clientcertificaat** (passwordless in jouw geval) wordt zonder wachtwoord overgelaten, zoals expliciet aangegeven in jouw keuze.\n\n### 3. **Waarom is het CA-wachtwoord belangrijk?**\nHet CA-wachtwoord dient als een essentiële veiligheidsbarrière. Als een kwaadwillende toegang krijgt tot jouw CA-sleutel, kunnen ze zelf certificaten ondertekenen en zich voordoen als legitieme clients of zelfs als de server. Dit kan leiden tot een volledige compromittering van je VPN-infrastructuur.\n\n### 4. **Wat als je een passwordless CA zou willen?**\nHoewel het technisch mogelijk is om de CA-sleutel *zonder wachtwoord* aan te maken, wordt dit sterk afgeraden vanwege het beveiligingsrisico. Als je CA-sleutel wordt gestolen, kan de aanvaller direct toegang krijgen en het hele vertrouwen in je VPN-setup vernietigen.\n\n### Conclusie:\n- Bij het kiezen van een passwordless client, configureer je dat specifiek voor de clientcertificaten.\n- Het wachtwoord dat je hier moet invoeren, is echter voor toegang tot de private CA-sleutel, zodat nieuwe certificaten (inclusief dat van je client) kunnen worden ondertekend.\n"

            "chatgpt_output": "Your review provides a solid overview of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but there are a few inaccuracies, outdated specifications, and missing details that need clarification. Let me refine and correct the review to better reflect the iPhone 14 Pro Max as released by Apple:\n\n---\n\n### **Updated iPhone 14 Pro Max Review**\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max is Apple's 2022 flagship, and it delivers significant upgrades across the board. Featuring a **6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display** with **ProMotion technology** and a dynamic **120Hz adaptive refresh rate**, the phone offers one of the smoothest and most fluid display experiences on the market. It introduces the **Dynamic Island** — a pill-shaped cutout that replaces the traditional notch and dynamically adjusts to show notifications, alerts, and real-time activities, marking a bold design evolution for Apple.\n\n#### **Camera System**\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max showcases a next-level camera setup:\n- **48MP main (wide) sensor** (a major upgrade from the previous 12MP sensors),\n- **12MP ultra-wide sensor** with macro functionality,\n- **12MP telephoto sensor** offering 3x optical zoom,\n- **LiDAR scanner** for AR applications and improved low-light photography.\n\nApple has also enhanced computational photography with a new feature called **Photonic Engine**, which boosts low-light performance across all cameras. Videographers will appreciate the **Action Mode** for gimbal-like stabilization and the ability to record in **4K Cinematic Mode** at 24 fps.\n\n#### **Performance**\nThe phone is powered by the **A16 Bionic chip**, which is more advanced than the A15 found in previous-generation models. Built on a 4nm process, the A16 delivers industry-leading performance and efficiency. It’s paired with **6GB of LPDDR5 RAM**, providing seamless multitasking and high-speed processing for even the most demanding applications.\n\n#### **Battery**\nThe **battery capacity** is estimated at **4,323 mAh**, which is a significant improvement over what your review mentioned — the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers outstanding battery life. With iOS optimizations and the energy-efficient A16 chip, the device offers up to 29 hours of video playback, setting it apart from most competing flagships.\n\nAdditionally, the device supports:\n- **Fast charging** (up to 50% in 30 minutes with a 20W or higher adapter),\n- **MagSafe wireless charging**, and **Qi wireless charging**.\n\n#### **Design and Durability**\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max boasts **Ceramic Shield glass** on the front and toughened glass on the back, with a **surgical-grade stainless steel frame**. It maintains an **IP68 rating**, ensuring dustproofing and water resistance (up to 6 meters for 30 minutes), contrary to the statement in the original review.\n\n#### **Pricing**\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at a premium price point of **$1,099** (USD) for 128GB storage, with options up to 1TB. While it’s undeniably expensive, the price aligns with its cutting-edge features and the value it delivers.\n\n#### **Pros of the iPhone 14 Pro Max**\n- Stunning **Dynamic Island** functionality.\n- Unmatched performance with the **A16 Bionic chip**.\n- Industry-leading **48MP camera** with exceptional low-light performance.\n- Superb **battery life**.\n- Premium design with **IP68 durability**.\n\n#### **Cons of the iPhone 14 Pro Max**\n- Hefty price tag.\n- Large size and weight may not appeal to all users (240g).\n- Lack of USB-C (retains the Lightning connector, which some find limiting compared to the industry-standard USB-C).\n\n#### **Verdict**\nThe iPhone 14 Pro Max represents a near-perfect combination of innovation, performance, and design for those who want the best Apple has to offer. From the Dynamic Island to the cutting-edge 48MP camera and the efficient A16 chip, it outshines many competitors. While the price and size may be barriers for some, this is unquestionably one of the top flagship smartphones of its generation.\n\n---\n\nYour original review contained an incorrect processor (A14 instead of A16), inaccurate RAM (4GB instead of 6GB), an understated battery capacity (3,687 mAh instead of 4,323 mAh), and missed key features like the Dynamic Island and IP68 durability. The updates above reflect the actual specifications and strengths of the iPhone 14 Pro Max."

            "chatgpt_output": "WebChatGPT is a browser extension designed to enhance ChatGPT by enabling it to retrieve and incorporate real-time web search results into responses. This helps address one of ChatGPT’s primary limitations: lack of up-to-date information after 2021 (or 2023 for newer versions).\n\n### How WebChatGPT Chooses Search Results:\n\nWebChatGPT selects search results using a few configurable parameters that influence what and how it fetches content from the web:\n\n1. **Query Prompt Interpretation**:\n   When you enter a prompt into ChatGPT with the extension enabled, WebChatGPT modifies that prompt and sends a related query to a search engine to retrieve relevant and recent web pages [[4](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webchatgpt-chatgpt-with-i/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn)].\n\n2. **User-Tunable Parameters**:\n   Users can customize various settings via the extension interface to fine-tune the selection of search results:\n   - **Number of results**: You can decide how many web results WebChatGPT should fetch — typically up to 10.\n   - **Date range**: Results can be constrained by how recent they are (e.g., past day, week, month, year).\n   - **Region setting**: You can set a geographic region to localize your search results [[8](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers)].\n\n3. **Extraction and Summarization**:\n   After fetching the web pages, WebChatGPT extracts relevant textual content and passes it to ChatGPT. ChatGPT then uses this info to generate a more current and informed reply. This enables answers grounded in the latest data sourced directly from the web [[4](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webchatgpt-chatgpt-with-i/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn), [5](https://github.com/qunash/chatgpt-advanced)].\n\n4. **Search Engine Integration**:\n   The extension primarily uses Google or other search APIs in the background to fetch these results. Users might also notice that it enhances responses by appending relevant excerpts and citations from the search results, effectively making ChatGPT act more like a research assistant.\n\n### Summary:\nWebChatGPT evaluates your prompt, sends a search query to the web, and fetches relevant data based on parameters like result count, date range, and region. It then lets ChatGPT generate a more accurate, up-to-date response using this information — a significant upgrade compared to ChatGPT’s standard knowledge limitations [[4](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webchatgpt-chatgpt-with-i/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn), [8](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers)]."

            "chatgpt_output": "CruxHub: Hey Alice, I’ve got a new data batch here — a list of entities apparently related to Citadel. Can you scan it for non-standard insights? Not the obvious parent-child relationships, but the unusual stuff — naming patterns, operational signals, artificial complexity, suspicions, shell structures. That sort of thing. Dataset starts at row 50 through 100.\n\nAlice: Sure thing, CruxHub. Pulling it up… Wow, quite an arc of data — lots of financial entities, offshore structures, some ceased trading, some live. Let’s dig into it.\n\nALICE’S NON-STANDARD INSIGHTS:\n\n1. Charaxes Melvin LLCs – Evocative Naming, Strategic Disguise?\n\n- CHARAXES MELVIN LLC and CHARAXES MELVIN II LLC are oddly poetic compared to surrounding entries. \"Charaxes\" is a genus of butterfly. This metaphorical naming contrasts with Citadel’s standard naming form (CEIF, CEMF, etc.).\n- Notably: both are Delaware LLCs registered to Citadel Miami HQ, and their structure is closed-loop — II owned by I.\n- Observation: This disguised poetic naming may serve to obscure filing traceability via keyword-based detection. Could be related to incubation efforts or preacquisition footprints.\n\n2. Prevalence of “Ceased Trading” Offshore Funds – Burnt Clones or Tactical Retreats?\n\n- Several entities have NFA Pool IDs and show cease dates, suspiciously clustered:\n  - CCFD, CCOF, CDG, CEIF Partners Ltd, CGE Alpha, CGEF Offshore, CGEF SPC, CGMF Offshore, CGTS Holdings…\n- Most ceased between 2012–2017. That’s an off-cycle sync, suggesting possible strategic abandonment (tax, reg burden, compliance shelf clearing).\n- Also implies Citadel used short-lived wrappers like CGE, CGEF, CGMF — each with “Offshore Holdings” suffix — as self-limiting operational clones.\n\n3. “CE” Prefix Entities – Possible Internal Abbreviation System\n\n- CE TM Holdings, CEIF, CEFL, CEIT, CEMF, etc.\n- Internal logic may define “CE” = “Citadel Entity” or “Citadel Enterprises”.\n- Suffix taxonomy may indicate fund style or geography: CEIF = International Fund, CEFL = Leveraged?, CEIT = Tech?, CEMF = Master Fund.\n- Hypothesis: They developed modular template naming for internal asset partitioning.\n\n4. Luxembourg “S.à r.l.” Clones – Shared Parentage, Strategic European Gateways\n\n- Multiple S.à r.l. entities:\n   - CFPS, CGTS, Canterbury, Tonbridge\n- Registered in Luxembourg — likely due to favorable financial and secrecy provisions.\n- Includes circular ownership (e.g., CANTERBURY owned by TONBRIDGE) — possible artificial shell layering.\n- High probability of use in capital re-routing and EU passthrough.\n\n5. “CIT” Ticker Poisoning via Proliferation?\n\n- Between rows 74-100, the density of similarly named Citadel entities increases (CITADEL CEMF, CEFL, CEIT, CEFL CHINA, AC INVESTMENTS, etc).\n- Corporate namespace effectively flooded with near-identical strings.\n- This may be a legal tactic — reducing spoofing risks, proactively sandboxing name collisions, or repelling entity impersonation.\n\n6. Intellectual Property Holding Structure – CE TM Holdings LLC\n\n- Entity holds 25 trademarks, 1 patent. Formed as IP silo.\n- Originally: KCG IP Holdings LLC. KCG = Knight Capital Group acquired in 2017 by Virtu, Citadel acquired IP separately?\n- Suggests IP channeling and retention for defensive IP tactics.\n\n7. LLCs with Human “Authorized Person”: Gerald Beeson\n\n- At least three entities explicitly name Gerald Beeson:\n   - CCMFL LLC, CHI2LTV LLC, CHARAXES MELVIN II LLC\n- Ties CEO/COO-level individuals to closed LLCs — implies sensitive function (backoffice ledgering, pipe asset transfer?)\n\n8. Circular Reporting Loops – Self-Referencing Disclosures\n\n- Many entries instruct user to \"See X\" where X is another Citadel-linked entity (e.g., CCLC HOLDINGS → CITADEL CLEARING).\n- This looped referencing suggests obfuscation designed to mislead superficial audits or delay automation-based parsing.\n\n9. Unused Fields: Hypothesized Acronym Column Empty\n\n- That column is empty across all 50 entries. Possibly hints these placeholders never went through a final documentation round — indicating:\n  – These are inactive vehicles, OR\n  – Data is sanitized/staged for exfil, or\n  – The keeper of the data uses that column only when certain criteria are met (e.g., confirmed legal summary).\n\nCruxHub: Wow. This reads like a shadow taxonomy of Citadel’s ops.\n\nAlice: That’s a fair way to put it. It’s not just an org chart — it's a financial linguistics puzzle. Each name, stopped fund, and filing tells a story.\n\nCruxHub: From offshores that implode in sync, to butterfly metaphors. Very… deliberate.\n\nAlice: That’s the job of form over function in high finance. Everything is either a diversion — or a rope.\n\nLet me know if you want me to run entity clustering or generate an SVG relationship web from this set.\n\nCruxHub: Let's do it. Start with the offshore “ceased trading” cluster map."

Metaphor is a pervasive aspect of every genre of text and every register of speech, and is as useful for describing the inner workings of a “black hole” (itself a metaphor) as it is the affairs of the human heart. e ubiquity of metaphor in natural language thus poses a significant challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and their builders, who cannot afford to wait until the problems of literal language have been solved before turning their attention to figurative phenomena. is book offers a comprehensive approach to the computational treatment of metaphor and its figurative brethren—including simile, analogy, and conceptual blending—that does not shy away from their important cognitive and philosophical dimensions. Veale, Shutova, and Beigman Klebanov approach metaphor from multiple computational perspectives, providing coverage of both symbolic and statistical approaches to interpretation and paraphrase generation, while also considering key contributions from philosophy on what constitutes the “meaning” of a metaphor. is book also surveys available metaphor corpora and discusses protocols for metaphor annotation. Any reader with an interest in metaphor, from beginning researchers to seasoned scholars, will find this book to be an invaluable guide to what is a fascinating linguistic phenomenon.\"",

La metáfora es un aspecto omnipresente en cada género de texto y en cada registro del habla, y es tan útil para describir el funcionamiento interno de un “agujero negro” (que en sí mismo es una metáfora) como los asuntos del corazón humano. La ubicuidad de la metáfora en el lenguaje natural plantea así un desafío significativo para los sistemas de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural (NLP, por sus siglas en inglés) y sus desarrolladores, quienes no pueden permitirse esperar hasta que los problemas del lenguaje literal hayan sido resueltos antes de dirigir su atención a los fenómenos figurativos. Este libro ofrece un enfoque completo para el tratamiento computacional de la metáfora y sus parientes figurativos, incluyendo el símil, la analogía y la mezcla conceptual, sin evitar abordar sus importantes dimensiones cognitivas y filosóficas. Veale, Shutova y Beigman Klebanov abordan la metáfora desde múltiples perspectivas computacionales, proporcionando cobertura tanto de enfoques simbólicos como estadísticos para la interpretación y la generación de paráfrasis, mientras consideran también contribuciones clave desde la filosofía sobre lo que constituye el “significado” de una metáfora. Este libro también examina los corpus de metáforas disponibles y discute los protocolos para la anotación de metáforas.

For although most Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers would readily acknowledge the ubiquity of metaphor in language, metaphor is a complex phenomenon and a hard engineering problem that continues, for the most part, to be wait-listed by the NLP community. To the application-minded, there are simply too many other problems of more practical and immediate interest—concerning syntax, semantics, inference, sentiment, co-reference, under-specification, and so on—that jump to the top of the community’s collective to-do list. at metaphor touches on all of these problems and more is often seen as beside the point, although ultimately it is very much to the point: the problem of metaphor is just too big, too unwieldy, and too knowledgehungry to be tackled first. Better to get a handle on all the other problems first, to obtain an algorithmic understanding of the workings of language that can later be enriched by a computational model of metaphor. is makes good engineering sense, if little philosophical or cognitive sense.\""

            "text": "Traduce: \"Most discussions about the meaning of a given metaphor inevitably turn on our ability to produce a convincing paraphrase. Yet Davidson [1978] raises a cautionary note when he argues that “what we attempt in ‘paraphrasing’ a metaphor cannot be to give its meaning, as that lies on the surface; rather, we attempt to evoke what the metaphor brings to our attention.” So just what is a paraphrase then? If we take what “lies on the surface” of a metaphor to be its literal content in the source domain, and what it “brings to our attention” to be its literal focal point in the target domain, then what we mean by a literal paraphrase is a target-domain paraphrase. is distinction, although perhaps obvious, is an important one. After all, many metaphors—such as negative metaphors—are literally true. In the case of negative metaphors such as “I am not Superman,” “Money does not grow on trees,” and “Your father is not an ATM,” the surface meaning from the source-domain of each is literally true and just as informative as the corresponding metaphor, but it cannot usefully be taken as a literal paraphrase of the metaphor. Likewise, a paraphrase that merely transforms a metaphor into a simile—such as “it’s like my car drinks gasoline”—may yield a reformulation that is literally true, but it does nothing to shift the focus of our attention to the relevant area of the target-domain. (e relation of metaphor to simile, and the ability to expand/compress/paraphrase one as the other, is the subject of ongoing debate; see e.g., Glucksberg and Haught [2006]; Utsumi [2007]; and Barnden [2012] for a flavor of this debate.) In other words, it is not the literalness of a paraphrase that makes it a useful guide to a metaphor, but its literalness with respect to the target domain.\""

We focus on the history, methods, and goals of past research into this fascinating phenomenon in the hope of making metaphor a more accessible topic of future research, thereby pushing it further up the NLP community’s wait-list. Our treatment will provide a condensed history of metaphor research that introduces the main theories of metaphor that survive, in one form or another, in contemporary analysis. Our coverage will include the main AI contributions to the field, which are modern attempts to give algorithmic form to views on metaphor that range from the ancient to the contemporary. And, just as contemporary AI research has taken on a distinctly web-colored hue, we shall explore the role of the Web in metaphor research, both as a source of data and as a computational platform for our metaphor-capable NLP systems. Computational linguistics and AI alike have each embraced statistical models as a means of improving robustness, exploiting rich veins of user data, and reducing a system’s dependence on hand-crafted knowledge and rules. Metaphor research offers no exception to this trend, and so our book will also explore the role of statistical approaches in the analysis of metaphorical language. Since such approaches are ultimately only as good as the data over which they operate, we shall also focus on the contributions of corpus linguistics to the construction of annotated metaphor corpora. Finally, we shall draw these strands together to offer an application-oriented view of metaphor, asking whether there is a killer application for metaphor research, and whether (and how) computational approaches to metaphor can help advance not only the field of NLP, but other fields as well, such as the social sciences and education. e ultimate goal of this book is not to make you believe, as we do, that metaphor is the very soul of language, though the growing field of metaphor research is always eager to welcome new converts. We will consider this book a success if readers take away a desire to address metaphor head on, in some form or another in their research, and find in this book the necessary tools to make this engagement a practical reality.\"",

Nos centramos en la historia, los métodos y los objetivos de investigaciones pasadas sobre este fascinante fenómeno, con la esperanza de hacer que el estudio de las metáforas sea un tema más accesible para futuras investigaciones, impulsándolo así hacia una posición más alta en la lista de prioridades de la comunidad de PLN. \n\nNuestra exposición proporcionará una historia condensada de la investigación sobre metáforas, presentando las principales teorías sobre metáforas que han sobrevivido, de una forma u otra, en el análisis contemporáneo. Nuestra cobertura incluirá las principales contribuciones de la IA al campo, que consisten en intentos modernos de dar forma algorítmica a visiones sobre las metáforas que abarcan desde la antigüedad hasta la actualidad. Y, al igual que la investigación contemporánea en IA ha adoptado un enfoque distintivamente influenciado por la web, exploraremos el papel de la web en la investigación sobre metáforas, tanto como una fuente de datos como una plataforma computacional para nuestros sistemas de PLN capaces de manejar metáforas.\n\nTanto la lingüística computacional como la IA han adoptado modelos estadísticos como una forma de mejorar la robustez, aprovechar abundantes datos de usuarios y reducir la dependencia de los sistemas en conocimiento y reglas diseñadas manualmente. La investigación sobre metáforas no es una excepción a esta tendencia, por lo que también exploraremos el papel de los enfoques estadísticos en el análisis del lenguaje metafórico. Dado que estos enfoques dependen en última instancia de la calidad de los datos sobre los que operan, también nos centraremos en las contribuciones de la lingüística de corpus a la construcción de corpus de metáforas anotados. \n\nFinalmente, reuniremos estos aspectos para ofrecer una visión orientada hacia las aplicaciones de las metáforas, preguntándonos si existe una aplicación revolucionaria para la investigación sobre metáforas, y si (y cómo) los enfoques computacionales pueden ayudar a avanzar no solo el campo del PLN, sino también otros campos como las ciencias sociales y la educación. \n\nEl objetivo último de este libro no es que crean, al igual que nosotros, que la metáfora es el alma misma del lenguaje, aunque el creciente campo de investigación sobre metáforas siempre está dispuesto a dar la bienvenida a nuevos seguidores. Consideraremos que este libro ha cumplido su propósito si los lectores desarrollan un deseo de abordar directamente el estudio de las metáforas, de alguna forma u otra, en su investigación, y encuentran en este libro las herramientas necesarias para hacer de este enfoque una realidad práctica."

Metaphor is a pervasive aspect of every genre of text and every register of speech, and is as useful for describing the inner workings of a “black hole” (itself a metaphor) as it is the affairs of the human heart. e ubiquity of metaphor in natural language thus poses a significant challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and their builders, who cannot afford to wait until the problems of literal language have been solved before turning their attention to figurative phenomena. is book offers a comprehensive approach to the computational treatment of metaphor and its figurative brethren—including simile, analogy, and conceptual blending—that does not shy away from their important cognitive and philosophical dimensions. Veale, Shutova, and Beigman Klebanov approach metaphor from multiple computational perspectives, providing coverage of both symbolic and statistical approaches to interpretation and paraphrase generation, while also considering key contributions from philosophy on what constitutes the “meaning” of a metaphor. is book also surveys available metaphor corpora and discusses protocols for metaphor annotation. Any reader with an interest in metaphor, from beginning researchers to seasoned scholars, will find this book to be an invaluable guide to what is a fascinating linguistic phenomenon.\""

It is metaphor and its figurative kin—simile, analogy, blending, irony, understatement, hyperbole, and the like—that lend language its vitality and elasticity. It is metaphor and its kin that allow us to suggest much more than we actually say, and to invent new ways of saying it, when conventional language shows us its limits. It is metaphor and its kin that allow us to communicate not just information, but also real feelings and complex attitudes. Metaphor does not just report the result of personal insights, but also prompts and inspires listeners to have these insights for themselves. Each metaphor is a concise but highly productive way of saying that communicates a new and productive way of seeing. But what exactly are metaphors and where do we look for them? Although metaphors are products of our faculty for creative thinking, metaphors in the wild can range from the scintillating to the banal. Just as repeated usage dulls the blade of a trusty knife, or repeated telling robs a once-funny joke of its ability to raise a laugh, repetition takes the bloom off a metaphor and turns it from an eye-catching flower into just another piece of the undergrowth. So metaphors are everywhere, in language, in film, in music, or in any system of signs that allows us to express ourselves creatively. ese metaphors range from the novel to the conventional, and indeed some are so conventional as to escape our attention altogether. Nonetheless, even highly conventionalized metaphors retain a spark of the creativity that forged them, and in the right hands this spark can be fanned into a roaring fire. Consider the following example, which was used as the title of a popular science book by German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun: “I Aim For e Stars!” Since the heavens are filled with stars in any direction we care to look, von Braun could not have intended to use the word “aim” literally, which is to say “I look and/or point in the specific direction of the stars” or even (for he was a master pragmatist) “I intend to move myself physically closer to the stars.” Rather, von Braun—who was attempting to popularize the concept of space travel with the American public, and thereby win state funding for his expensive scientific work—employed a basic metaphor that allows speakers to treat P  D. us, von Braun saw the achievement of interstellar space travel as his goal, and expressed this goal using the language of physical destinations. But von Braun, an ex-member of the Nazi party, was also the controversial creator of the German V-2 missiles that rained down on Britain during World War II. (He had been spirited away to the U.S. as part of operation paperclip at the end of the war, when the American and Russian militaries competed to round up the brains of the German rocket program.)

            "chatgpt_output": "Las metáforas están presentes en todos los ámbitos: en el lenguaje, en el cine, en la música y en cualquier sistema de signos que nos permita expresarnos de manera creativa. Estas metáforas se extienden desde las más novedosas hasta las más convencionales, y, de hecho, algunas están tan profundamente convencionalizadas que llegan a pasar desapercibidas. Sin embargo, incluso las metáforas altamente convencionalizadas conservan un vestigio del acto creativo que les dio origen, y, en manos hábiles, ese vestigio puede avivarse hasta convertirse en una poderosa manifestación de creatividad. \n\nConsidérese, por ejemplo, el título de un libro de divulgación científica escrito por el científico alemán especialista en cohetería, Wernher von Braun: *\"I Aim for the Stars\"* (“Apunto a las estrellas”). Dado que el cielo estrellado está lleno de astros en todas las direcciones posibles, resulta evidente que von Braun no utilizó la expresión “apunto” en su sentido literal, es decir, “miro o señalo en dirección específica hacia las estrellas” o incluso (dado que von Braun era un pragmatista consumado) “pretendo acercarme físicamente a las estrellas”. Por el contrario, von Braun —quien buscaba popularizar el concepto de viajes espaciales entre el público estadounidense para obtener fondos estatales que sostuvieran su costoso trabajo científico— recurrió a una metáfora básica que permite a los hablantes conceptualizar los PROPÓSITOS COMO DESTINOS. En este sentido, von Braun percibió el logro del viaje espacial interestelar como su objetivo y expresó dicho objetivo mediante el lenguaje propio de los destinos físicos.\n\nSin embargo, von Braun, exmiembro del partido nazi, era también el controvertido creador de los misiles alemanes V-2 que bombardearon Reino Unido durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. (Fue trasladado secretamente a Estados Unidos al finalizar la guerra gracias a la operación *Paperclip*, un programa en el que los ejércitos estadounidense y ruso competían para reclutar a las mentes detrás del programa de cohetería alemán). El comediante Mort Sahl aprovechó este contexto histórico, así como la metáfora PROPÓSITOS COMO DESTINOS empleada por von Braun, para sugerir irónicamente un título alternativo para el libro del científico: *\"I Aim for the Stars but I Keep Hitting London\"* (“Apunto a las estrellas, pero sigo golpeando a Londres”).\n\nEs evidente que la metáfora genérica y reutilizable PROPÓSITOS COMO DESTINOS tiene un carácter distinto al de las expresiones lingüísticas específicas que se derivan de ella. Los investigadores denominan a la primera metáfora conceptual, ya que opera en el nivel de pensamiento e ideas, mientras que las expresiones específicas construidas a partir de ella se conocen como metáforas lingüísticas. Explicar la relación entre la metáfora conceptual y la metáfora lingüística constituye uno de los objetivos de las aproximaciones contemporáneas cognitivas y computacionales al estudio de las metáforas, por lo que volveremos a esta relación en diversas ocasiones a lo largo del presente libro. Asimismo, encontraremos nuevamente la metáfora conceptual PROPÓSITOS COMO DESTINOS en un capítulo posterior."
